## ***Background***

Modern research in bacterial genetics was built on a foundation of many early papers, where researchers designed and interpreted experiments in the absence of easily obtained genomic data. These early papers provide snapshots into the context of how scientists were thinking at the time, provide examples of elegant experimental designs that allowed researchers to probe genetic pathways in organisms that they couldn't easily see, and highlight (sometimes) incredible lessons in deductive reasoning and data interpretation. On the other hand...they got a lot of stuff wrong too.

The goal for this journal club is to cover some of these early papers and work through the experimental designs, interpretations, and logical leaps that arose from this work. As such, we're going to limit papers to those published before the modern genomic era (pre-2000).
